## Executive Summary

The EVConnectNepal system employs a sophisticated hybrid algorithm that combines multiple algorithmic approaches to solve the complex problem of EV charging station recommendation in Nepal's unique geographical and infrastructural context. This document provides a detailed breakdown of each algorithm component and its specific purpose.

## 1. Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) Scoring System

### Purpose: Comprehensive Station Evaluation
**Location**: `backend/services/Hybrid_Algorithm.py` - `calculate_enhanced_score()` method

**What it does**: Evaluates charging stations using a weighted scoring system that considers multiple factors simultaneously.

**Why it's needed**: Simple distance-based recommendations fail to capture the complexity of EV charging decisions, which must balance proximity, availability, cost, compatibility, and user preferences.

**Implementation Details**:
```python
weights = {
    'distance': 0.25,           # 25% weight - Proximity optimization
    'availability': 0.20,       # 20% weight - Real-time slot availability
    'energy_efficiency': 0.15,  # 15% weight - Energy consumption optimization
    'urgency': 0.15,           # 15% weight - User urgency consideration
    'price': 0.10,             # 10% weight - Cost sensitivity
    'plug_compatibility': 0.10, # 10% weight - Technical compatibility
    'rating': 0.05             # 5% weight - User satisfaction
}
```
